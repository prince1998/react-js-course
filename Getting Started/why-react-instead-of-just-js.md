# Why React instead of just "Javascript"

Why not Javascript?
- Javascript follows an imperative approach where we define action after action 
- We have to take care of all nittty gritty detail
- Involves doing repetetive task and reinventing the wheel everytime

Why React?
- React is all about creating maintainable and manageable code
- You build custom components; React renders those custom components
- It is not repetetive and not imperative
