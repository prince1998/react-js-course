# How is a component build?

We combine HTML, CSS and JS in all these components. And all components combine together to make user interface.

# React and components
- React allows you to create re-usable and reactive components consisting of HTML and JavaScript (and CSS)
- React uses a "declarative approach" to make these components.
- You would have to define target state(s) and let React figure out the actual JavaScript DOM instructions.
- We just build our own custom HTML elements and combine them together to make our user interface.
