# What are components and why is react all about them?

- React is a JavaScript library for building user interfaces.

- React makes building complex, interactive and reactive user interfaces simpler.

- React is all about "components"
    - Because all user interfaces in the end are made up of components; components eg: chart, label, input fields, etc 
    - components are reusable building blocks in your user interface

- Why Components?
    - Reusability: Dont repeat yourself
    - Separation of concerns: Dont do too many things in one and same place (function)
    - Split big chunks of code into multiple smaller functions
