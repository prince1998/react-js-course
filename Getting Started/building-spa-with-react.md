# Building Sinple Page Applications

2 approaches to use React:
- "Widgets" approach on a multi-page application. (Some) pages are still rendered on and served by a backend server React can be used to **control parts** of HTML page or entire pages using Widgets. 
- **Single Page Application approach**: Server only sends one HTML Page, thereafter, React takes over and controls the UI. Here, React is being used to control entire frontend of web application.
